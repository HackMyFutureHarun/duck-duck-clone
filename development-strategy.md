# Development Strategy

> `duck-duck-clone`

This project is one of assignment for students in HFY Coding Class. The main goal is to recreate the same or similar page to what has been assigned to. This project has two steps:
1.	Preparation, which means preparing the repo as needed, not only repository owner responsibility.
2.	The project is ready to clone and ready to make which means each collaborators start contributing their part on this project, as instructed on the development strategy. 
This project is good for those who want to train themselves in making website using HTML and CSS, including making a responsive design.
